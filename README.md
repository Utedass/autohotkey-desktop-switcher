# Desktop switching script using autohotkey and VD.v2

CTRL + ALT + Right/Left changes desktop. (Also works with AltGr key)

CapsLock + Right/Left moves current window.

Check out the v2_port branch from the following repo, in a folder adjacent to this folder
https://github.com/FuPeiJiang/VD.ahk/tree/v2_port#readme

The folder structure should now be 

```
Parent folder
|- autohotkey-desktop-switcher/
| |-desktop-switcher.ah2
|- VD.ahk/
  |-AD.ah2
```
